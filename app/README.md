- 🛡️ Admin user management — invite, role assignment, deactivate (RBAC Phase 1)

## Tech stack

- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) SDK 54 (React Native 0.81)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) — file-based routing
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) — server state and caching
- [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) — internationalization
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) — HTTP client with auth interceptors
- [@expo/vector-icons](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/icons/) — Ionicons throughout

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- Node 18+ and npm
- A running [mycongregation-server](https://github.com/Backmann/mycongregation-server) backend (local or staging — see that repo for setup)
- Optional: Xcode (iOS simulator), Android Studio (Android emulator) — only needed for native builds; web works in any browser

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Backmann/mycongregation-app.git
cd mycongregation-app
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file at the repo root:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.mycongregation.org/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY=<public VAPID key for web push (ask the backend admin)>
```

For local backend development, point at `http://localhost:3002/api` instead.

> Note: `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables are inlined into the JS bundle at build time and are intentionally not secret. The VAPID public key is published as such; the matching private key lives only on the server.

### Run

```bash
npm start
```

In the Expo CLI prompt, press:

- `w` — open in web browser
- `i` — open in iOS simulator
- `a` — open in Android emulator

For just the web build during day-to-day work:

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

### Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

CI gates on zero warnings.

## Building for production

The web build is what ships to https://mycongregation.org:

```bash
npx expo export --platform web
# Outputs a static bundle to dist/
```

In CI/CD, the export step builds the bundle and SCPs it to the production server's `/var/www/` directory, served by Caddy with HTTPS terminated at Cloudflare.

## Project structure

```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) runs on every push to `main`:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run lint` (ESLint — blocks on warnings)
3. `npx expo export --platform web`
4. `scp` the bundle to the production server
5. Atomic swap into `/var/www/`

A typical deploy completes in ~90 seconds.

## Roadmap

- Sub-role permissions (responsibilities entity — Phase 2 RBAC)
- Native iOS and Android builds via EAS Build
- Offline-first service reports
- Expanded i18n (more EPUB parsers per language)
- Jest test suite
